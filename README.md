# HSG-Project-Mosaic (Python)
***Project Description***

This is a student project of the University of St. Gallen within the course Programming – Introduction Level. Python is the programming language used for the project. The goal of the project was to create a mosaic of a target picture by downloading over 1000 bee pictures from Flickr. We, Nikolas and Moritz, are both very interested in art, which gave us the motivation to see this project as an opportunity to explore how programming might contribute to modern art.

The program first fetches bee pictures from Flickr since they appear in many different colors, making the final mosaic target picture more vivid. These pictures are downloaded and cropped to a unified shape. Resizing serves the purpose of creating a mosaic of a previously selected target picture by putting them together. In order to create the mosaic, the target image needs to be split in smaller images as a first step. For these smaller pictures the average RGB color needs to be calculated. Same needs to be done for the input images. The generated multiple target images and the input images can be compared for the best match index and finally, target images can be replaced by input images with the best match. The initial target picture is now displayed as a mosaic of colorful bee pictures.


***Pre-requisites***

The program works with Python3.
In order to run it, the following libraries need to be installed:
-	Library 1
-	Library 2
-	…


***Instructions***

Note: It is not necessary to download and resize all the pictures. Downloading over 1000 pictures can take some time. Therefore, we already uploaded the pictures under the folder “Input”. The folder is called “Bees.zip”. 

To download and resize pictures:
1.	Start Download&Resize.py
2.	…

To create the mosaic:
1.	Start Create_Moaic.py
2.	…

Exemplary outputs can be found in the folder “Outputs”.
